<h2>ðŸ––, I'm Pratyay Pandey</h2>
Sorry if there's not much to see; a lot of my code is private! 

But here's what I'm up to these days:
- Studying EECS and Math/Stats @ UC Berkeley
- Working on and researching LOTUS under Prof. Matei Zahari and Carlos Guestrin at the Stanford AI Lab and Berkeley Sky Computing Lab
- Making fine-tuning multimodal models as easy as Scratch @ Eregion

Have a fun idea in mind? Feel free to reach out at [firstname][at]berkeley.edu!
