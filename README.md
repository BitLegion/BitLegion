<h2>ðŸ––, I'm Pratyay Pandey</h2>
Sorry if there's not much to see; a lot of my code is private! 

But here's what I'm up to these days:
- Studying EECS and Math/Stats @ UC Berkeley 
- Creating next-level neural network analytics @ Eregion
- Building voice-activated agentic workflows @ Uncountable Inc. 

Have a fun idea in mind? Feel free to reach out at p.pandey[at]berkeley.edu!
